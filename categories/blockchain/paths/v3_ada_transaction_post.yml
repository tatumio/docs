  <p>Send ADA to blockchain addresses.</p>

  <p>Cardano transactions are based on UTXOs. "UTXO" stands for "Unspent Transaction
  Output". A UTXO is the amount of ADA that remains at a Cardano address after a cryptocurrency
  transaction involving this address has been performed. The UTXO can then be used
  as input for a new cryptocurrency transaction. For more information about the UTXO,
  see the <a href="https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html" target="_blank">Bitcoin
  user documentation</a>.</p>

  <p>You can build an ADA transaction by one of the following methods:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><b>Sending ADA from blockchain addresses</b><br/>The assets are sent from a
  list of addresses. For each address, the last 100 transactions are scanned for any
  UTXO to be included in the transaction. For easier control over the assets to be
  sent, we recommend that you use this method only if you have one address to send
  the assets from.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>AdaTransactionFromAddress</code>
  or <code>AdaTransactionFromAddressKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>

  <li><b>Sending ADA from UTXOs</b><br/>The assets are sent from a list of UTXOs.
  Each UTXO is included in the transaction. Use this method if you want to manually
  calculate the amount to send.<br/> To use this method, use the <code>AdaTransactionFromUTXO</code>
  or <code>AdaTransactionFromUTXOKMS</code> schema of the request body.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>When an UTXO is entered into a transaction, the whole UTXO amount is included
  and must be spent. For example, address A receives two transactions, T1 with 1 ADA
  and T2 with 2 ADA. A transaction that consumes the UTXOs from both T1 and T2 will
  have an available amount of 3 ADA to spend:<br/><code>1 ADA (from T1) + 2 ADA (from
  T2) = 3 ADA (to spend in total)</code></p>

  <p>You can send the assets to one or multiple recipients in one transaction. If
  you send the assets to multiple addresses, each address must have its own amount
  to receive.</p>

  <p><b>Paying the gas fee and receiving the change</b><br/>

  When the amount that the recipients should receive is lower than the amount from
  the UTXOs, the difference between these two amounts is by default used as the gas
  fee for the transaction. Because this amount may be considerable and you may not
  want to spend it all on the gas fee, you can explicitly specify the fee amount and
  the blockchain address where any extra funds remaining after covering the fee will
  be sent (the <code>fee</code> and <code>changeAddress</code> parameters in the request
  body, correspondingly).</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When sending ADA, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the
  transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will
  be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
