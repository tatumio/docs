  You can work with Cardano by <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Node-RPC#operation/NodeJsonPostRpcDriver"
  target="_blank">connecting directly to a blockchain node provided by Tatum</a>.</b></p><br/>

  <h4>1 credit per API call.</h4><p>Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. Because they
  can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase, they are very convenient and
  secure. A mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in a defined order and can
  restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.<br/>Each address is
  identified by 3 main values:<ul><li>Private Key - your secret value, which should
  never be revealed</li><li>Public Key - public address to be published</li><li>Derivation
  index - index of generated address</li></ul></p><p>Tatum follows BIP44 specification
  and generates for ADA wallet with derivation path m/1852''/1815''/0''. More about
  BIP44 HD wallets can be found here - <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki">https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki</a>.
