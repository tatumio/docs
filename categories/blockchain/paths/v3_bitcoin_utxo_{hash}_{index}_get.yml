description: '<p><b>1 credit per API call</b></p>

  <p>Get information about a transaction output in a transaction and check whether
  this output is a UTXO or has been spent.</p>

  <p>"UTXO" stands for "Unspent Transaction Output". A UTXO is the amount of BTC/satoshis
  that remains at a Bitcoin address after a cryptocurrency transaction involving this
  address has been performed. The UTXO can then be used as input for a new cryptocurrency
  transaction. For more information about Bitcoin transactions and UTXO, see the <a
  href="https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html" target="_blank">Bitcoin
  user documentation</a>.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>If the transaction output is an UTXO, the API returns data about it.</li>

  <li>If the transaction output has been spent and there is no UTXO to return, the
  API returns an error with the <code>404</code> response code.</li>

  </ul>
