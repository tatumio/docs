  <p>Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. Because they can generate 2^31 addresses from
  1 mnemonic phrase, they are very convenient and secure. A mnemonic phrase consists
  of 24 special words in a defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses
  and private keys.<br/>Each address is identified by 3 main values:<ul><li>Private
  Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed</li><li>Public Key - public
  address to be published</li><li>Derivation index - index of generated address</li></ul></p><p>Tatum
  follows BIP44 specification and generates for Bitcoin wallet with derivation path
  m''/44''/0''/0''/0. More about BIP44 HD wallets can be found here - <a target="_blank"
