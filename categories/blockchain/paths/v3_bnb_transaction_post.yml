  \ of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction\
  \ must be signed with the corresponding private key.\nNo one should ever send it's\
  \ own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing\

  PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain\
