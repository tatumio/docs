description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Send BNB or Tatum supported BEP20 token from account to account.<br/><br/>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b></p>

  <p>When sending BNB, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign
  the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee
  will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
