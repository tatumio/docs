  <p>Get information about a transaction output in a transaction and check whether
  this output is a UTXO or has been spent.</p>

  <p>"UTXO" stands for "Unspent Transaction Output". A UTXO is the amount of DOGE
  that remains at a Dogecoin address after a cryptocurrency transaction involving
  this address has been performed. The UTXO can then be used as input for a new cryptocurrency
  transaction. For more information about the UTXO, see the <a href="https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/transactions.html"
  target="_blank">Bitcoin user documentation</a>.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>If the transaction output is an UTXO, the API returns data about it.</li>

  <li>If the transaction output has been spent and there is no UTXO to return, the
  API returns an error with the <code>404</code> response code.</li>

  </ul>
