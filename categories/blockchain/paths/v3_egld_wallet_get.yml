  <p>The Elrond Address format is bech32, specified by the BIP 0173. The address always
  starts with an erd1. It is very convenient and secure, since it can generate 2^31
  addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase.

  Mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in defined order and can restore access
  to all generated addresses and private keys.

  <br/>

  Each address is identified by 3 main values:

  <ul><li>Private Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed</li>

  <li>Public Key - public address to be published</li>

  <li>Derivation index - index of generated address</li></ul>

  </p>

  <p>Tatum follows BIP44 specification and generates for EGLD wallet with derivation
  path m''/44''/508''/0''/0''.
