description: '<h4>1 credit per API call.</h4><br/><p>Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets.
  Because they can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase, they are very convenient
  and secure. A mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in a defined order and
  can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.<br/>Each address
  is identified by 3 main values:<ul><li>Private Key - your secret value which should
  never be revealed</li><li>Public Key - a public address to be published</li><li>Derivation
  index - an index of generated address</li></ul></p><p>Tatum follows the BIP44 specification
  and generates for Ethereum wallets with the derivation path m/44''/60''/0''/0. More
