description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Send FLR or Tatum-supported fungible tokens (ERC-20) from account to account.</p>

  <p style="border:4px solid DeepSkyBlue;"><b>NOTE:</b> Sending the fungible tokens
  is supported only on the mainnet.</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When sending FLR, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the
  transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will
  be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
