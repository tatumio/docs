description: '<h4>100 credits per API call. Tatum covers the fee connected to the
  transaction costs in subscription credits. This operation can be done on mainnet
  only for paid plans.</h4><br/>

  <p>Add public key to existing Flow blockchain addresses. Private key for that public
  key can be used for signing transaction.

  There are two possibilites how the transaction on the blockchain can be created:

  <ul>

  <li>Using mnemonic and index - private key is generated based on the index in the
  mnemonic.</li>

  <li>Using secret - private keys is entered manually.</li>

  </ul><br/><br/>

  This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds
  are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.

  No one should ever send it''s own private keys to the internet because there is
  a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible
  to enter privateKey

  or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet
  versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,

  <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should
  be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in
  the request.

  Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.
