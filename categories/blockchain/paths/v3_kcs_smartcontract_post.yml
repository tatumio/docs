description: "<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Invoke a method in an existing\
  \ smart contract on KuCoin Community Chain.</p>\n<p>You can call a read-only or\
  \ write method.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For <b>read-only</b> methods, the output of the invoked\

  Tatum ensures that this API works against the blockchain (accesses the blockchain,\
  \ finds the specified smart contract, and executes the specified ABI method with\
  \ the provided parameters).<br/>However, because this API can be run against any\
  \ smart contract on the blockchain, Tatum cannot in any way guarantee that the method\
  \ itself will be executed successfully.</p>\n<p>If you have issues with invoking\
  \ the method, refer to the user documentation for this method, or contact the author\
  \ of the smart contract.</p>\n<p>For more information about invoking methods in\
  \ smart contracts, see <a href=\"https://support.tatum.io/support/solutions/articles/80001052441\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">this article</a> on our Support Portal.</p>\n<p><b>Signing a\
  \ transaction</b><br/>\nWhen invoking a method in a smart contract, you are charged\
  \ a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private\
  \ key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>\n<p>Providing\
  \ the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions, because\
  \ the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never leave\
  \ your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing a solution\
  \ you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>\n<p>For signing transactions\
  \ on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum <a href=\"\
  https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\" target=\"_blank\">Key Management System (KMS)</a>\
  \ and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API. Alternatively,\
  \ you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2\" target=\"\
  _blank\">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>\n"
