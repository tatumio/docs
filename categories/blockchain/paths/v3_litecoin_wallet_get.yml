  It is very convenient and secure, since it can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic
  phrase. Mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in defined order and can restore
  access to all generated addresses and private keys.<br/>Each address is identified
  by 3 main values:<ul><li>Private Key - your secret value, which should never be
  revealed</li><li>Public Key - public address to be published</li><li>Derivation
  index - index of generated address</li></ul></p><p>Tatum follows BIP44 specification
  and generates for Litecoin wallet with derivation path m''/44''/2''/0''/0. More
