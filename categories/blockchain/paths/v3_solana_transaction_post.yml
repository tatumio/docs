  <p>Send SOL from account to account.<br/><br/>

  This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds
  are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.

  No one should ever send it''s own private keys to the internet because there is
  a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible
  to enter privateKey

  or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet
  versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,

  <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should
  be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in
  the request.

  Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.
