summary: Freeze the balance of a TRON account
description: '<p><b>10 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Freeze Tron assets on the address. By freezing assets, you can obtain energy
  or bandwidth to perform transactions.</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When freezing the balance, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must
  sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the
  fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
