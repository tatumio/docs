  <p>Retrieve unspent UTXOs for each provided address, up to a specified total amount.

  If you want to prepare a transaction on UTXO-based chains like Bitcoin, you need
  to enter unspent UTXOs to be able to perform a transaction. By providing ```totalValue```
  as a total, our API will return a list of UTXOs that will be enough to cover the
  transaction.</p>

  Our API lets you get the unpenst UTXOs for a specific address on:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Bitcoin - bitcoin / bitcoin-testnet</li>

  <li>Litecoin - litecoin / litecoin-testnet</li>

  <li>Dogecoin - doge / doge-testnet</li>

  <li>Cardano - cardano / cardano-preprod</li>

  </ul>

  <p>To get started:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Provide a chain and addresses you want to list unspent UTXOs for. If available,
  our API will return information about the unspent UTXOs for each address. API traverses
  latest 200k incoming transactions.</li>

  </ul>
