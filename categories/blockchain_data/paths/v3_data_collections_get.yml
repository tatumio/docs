description: "<p><b>10 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Get all NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) and multitokens (ERC-1155 only) of your favorite
  collections! Our API lets you search for all tokens on:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Celo - celo / celo-testnet</li>

  <li>Ethereum - ethereum / ethereum-sepolia</li>

  <li>BNB (Binance) Smart Chain - bsc / bsc-testnet</li>

  <li>Polygon - polygon / polygon-mumbai</li>

  <li>Horizen EON - eon-mainnet</li>

  <li>Chiliz - chiliz-mainnet</li>

  <li>Tezos - tezos-mainnet</li>

  </ul>

  <p>To get started:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Provide a chain name and comma-separated list of collection addresses. Our API
  will return relevant information about each token, including its name, description,
  image, and more.</li>

  <li>Aside from relevant information about each token, the response also contains
  metadata (they can, however, be excluded by setting <code>excludeMetadata</code>
  to <code>true</code>).</li>

  <li>If not specified, the API returns results for all supported types of tokens
  (nft, multitokens), but you can also choose to filter only one <code>tokenType</code>.</li>

  <li>For Tezos blockchain query parameters <code>excludeMetadata</code> and <code>tokenType</code>
  won't have any effect on filtering data.</li>

  </ul>
