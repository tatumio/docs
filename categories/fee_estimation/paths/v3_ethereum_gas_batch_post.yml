description: '<p><b>10 credits per API call + 10 credits per each gas estimation</b></p>

  <p>Get an estimated gas price and the number of gas units needed for multiple Ethereum
  transactions. The gas price is obtained from multiple sources and calculated based
  on the latest N blocks and the current mempool state.</p>

  <p>The estimations are returned in the same order as the transactions were submitted
  in the request.</p>

  <p>The <code>fast</code> gas price is used by default.</p>

  <p style="border:4px solid DeepSkyBlue;"><b>NOTE:</b> The estimated gas price is
  returned in <b>wei</b>. However, when <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Ethereum#operation/EthBlockchainTransfer"
  target="_blank">making a transaction itself</a> and providing the custom fee, you
  have to provide the gas price in <b>Gwei</b>. Make sure to convert the estimated
  gas price from wei to Gwei before submitting your transaction.</p>
