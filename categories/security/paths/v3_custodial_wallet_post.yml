description: '<h4>2 credits per API call, 10 credits for each managed wallet every
  day.</h4><br/>

  <p>Create new managed address for a specific chain. If the address is mainnet or
  testnet one depends on the API Key - testnet API Key manages testnet addresses,
  mainnet API Key manages mainnet addresses.

  Result of the operation is address and walletId, which is used for identifying the
  wallet later on and/or exporting the private key if needed.<br/>

  Free users can manage only 10 addresses per API Key.
