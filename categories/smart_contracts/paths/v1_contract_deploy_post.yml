description: "This operation is used to create a new smart contract on the blockchain.\
  \ The operation is asynchronous and returns a transaction hash. The transaction\
  \ hash can be used to query the status of the transaction.<br/>\nYou can create\
  \ the following types of contracts:\n<ul>\n  <li>ERC-20 - Fungible token like USDT</li>\n\
  \  <li>ERC-721 - NFT collection like BAYC</li>\n  <li>ERC-1155 - MultiToken NFT\
  \ collection</li>\n</ul>\nYou can find more information about the contracts on our\
  \ <a href=\"https://github.com/tatumio/smart-contract-library\" target=\"_blank\"\
  >GitHub page</a> with steps required for verification.<br/>\nIf you deploy NFT collection\
  \ contract (ERC-721), it is automatically enabled for <a href=\"https://docs.tatum.io/nft-express/what-is-nft-express\"\
  \ target=\"_blank\">NFT Express functionality.</a><br/>\n"
