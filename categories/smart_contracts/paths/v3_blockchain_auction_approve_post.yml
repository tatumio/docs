  <p>Allow the NFT auction/marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset (NFT or
  Multi Token) that is listed for selling.<br/>The auction/marketplace smart contract
  will transfer the asset to the buyer after the asset is purchased.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When allowing the NFT auction/marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset,
  you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with
  the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
