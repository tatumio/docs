description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Settle an auction once it has ended and there is a buyer of the asset at this
  auction. Settling the auction means that the asset is transferred to the buyer,
  the amount is transferred to the seller, and the fee is transferred to the fee recipient
  of the auction.<br/>Both seller and buyer can settle the auction.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>The "execution reverted" message</b><br/>

  When making this API call, you may get the following message:<br/>

  <code>Although one or more Error Occurred [execution reverted] Contract Execution
  Completed</code><br/>

  This message is a result of the auction version check and has no impact on completing
  the API call. You can safely ignore it.</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When settling the NFT auction, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you
  must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which
  the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
