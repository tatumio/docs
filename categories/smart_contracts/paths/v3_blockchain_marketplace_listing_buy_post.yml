description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Buy an asset listed on the NFT marketplace.</p>

  <p>You can buy the asset either for the native blockchain currency (for example,
  ETH, MATIC, and so on) or for the fungible tokens of the blockchain.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>If you want to pay for the asset with the <b>native blockchain currency</b>,
  send the required amount plus the marketplace fee right in the API call (in the
  <code>amount</code> request body parameter).</li>

  <li>If you want to pay with the <b>fungible tokens</b>, <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Fungible-Tokens-(ERC-20-or-compatible)#operation/Erc20Approve"
  target="_blank">allow the marketplace smart contract to access your tokens</a> before
  making the purchase. When you make the API call, the marketplace smart contract
  will deduct the required amount of the tokens from the smart contract where you
  hold the tokens.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>Solana (in <b>alpha</b>)</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>The "execution reverted" message</b><br/>

  When making this API call, you may get the following message:<br/>

  <code>Although one or more Error Occurred [execution reverted] Contract Execution
  Completed</code><br/>

  This message is a result of the marketplace version check and has no impact on completing
  the API call. You can safely ignore it.</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When buying an asset on the NFT marketplace, you are charged a fee for the transaction,
  and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address
  from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
