description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Cancel the selling of an asset on the NFT marketplace.</p>

  <p>You can cancel the selling only if you are the seller of the asset or the marketplace
  operator. Once the selling is canceled, the asset is returned to the seller.</p>

  <p>You cannot cancel the selling if the asset has already been purchased.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>Solana (in <b>alpha</b>)</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>The "execution reverted" message</b><br/>

  When making this API call, you may get the following message:<br/>

  <code>Although one or more Error Occurred [execution reverted] Contract Execution
  Completed</code><br/>

  This message is a result of the marketplace version check and has no impact on completing
  the API call. You can safely ignore it.</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When cancelling the selling of an asset, you are charged a fee for the transaction,
  and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address
  from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
