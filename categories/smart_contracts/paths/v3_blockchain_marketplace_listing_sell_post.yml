description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Create a new listing for an asset on the NFT marketplace. The listing can be
  offered for the native blockchain assets (for example, ETH, MATIC, and so on) or
  for any fungible tokens.</p>

  <p>After the listing is created, <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Auction#operation/ApproveNftAuctionSpending"
  target="_blank">allow the marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset that
  you are selling</a>.</p>

  <p>You can create a listing only for an existing asset that you own (you must be
  the owner of the asset).</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>Solana (in <b>alpha</b>)</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>A known issue on Harmony</b><br/>

  On Harmony, when you are viewing a transaction in the Harmony Blockchain Explorer,
  the transaction status may be displayed as the following:<br/>

  <code>Error reverted:x0</code><br/>

  This is a known issue with the Harmony Blockchain Explorer. This status does not
  mean that the transaction failed. You can safely ignore it.</p>

  <p><b>The "execution reverted" message</b><br/>

  When making this API call, you may get the following message:<br/>

  <code>Although one or more Error Occurred [execution reverted] Contract Execution
  Completed</code><br/>

  This message is a result of the marketplace version check and has no impact on completing
  the API call. You can safely ignore it.</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When creating a new listing on the NFT marketplace, you are charged a fee for the
  transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain
  address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
