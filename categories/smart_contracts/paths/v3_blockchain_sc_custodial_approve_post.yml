description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Allow another blockchain address (the <code>spender</code> parameter in the request
  body) to transfer the asset from a gas pump address on behalf of the master address.</p>

  <p>Use this API when the customer using the gas pump address sells assets on a marketplace
  or auction. After the customer creates a listing of the asset, they have to allow
  the marketplace/auction smart contract to transfer the asset to the buyer after
  the asset has been bought.</p>

  <p>The asset can be one of the following types:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Fungible token (ERC-20 or equivalent)</li>

  <li>NFT (ERC-721 or equivalent)</li>

  <li>Multi Token (ERC-1155 or equivalent)</li>

  </ul>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>XinFin</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When approving the transfer of an asset, you are charged a fee for the transaction,
  and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address
  from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
