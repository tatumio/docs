description: '<p><b>This API is deprecated.<br/>To start with the gas pump, use the
  <a href="#operation/PrecalculateGasPumpAddresses">API for precalculating the gas
  pump addresses</a>.</b></p>

  <p><b>If you built your gas pump solution using this API and the <a href="#operation/GenerateCustodialWalletBatch">API
  for generating a gas pump wallet address</a>, you can still use this API for creating
  more custodial addresses for your solution. However, we recommend that you switch
  to the <a href="#operation/PrecalculateGasPumpAddresses">API for precalculating
  the gas pump addresses</a></b>.</p><br/>

  <p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Generate new gas pump smart contract address on the blockchain. It''s possible
  to enable tokens, which should be detected and supported on that address. This address
  enables custodial providers to

  receive native assets, ERC20 / ERC721 / ERC1155 tokens on behalf of their customers
  on dedicated blockchain address, but in the same time it can initiate transfer of
  those assets away.</p>

  <p>Gas required for the transfer from that address is going to be deducted from
  the providers address - the one, which was used to generate the address on the blockchain.</p>

  <p>There are multiple options, how this address can be setup - it cannot be changed
  in the future:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Native assets only - ETH, BSC, CELO, MATIC, ONE, TRX</li>

  <li>Native assets + ERC20 tokens</li>

  <li>Native assets + ERC721 tokens</li>

  <li>Native assets + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155 standard</li>

  <li>Native assets + ERC20 + ERC721 tokens</li>

  <li>Native assets + ERC20 + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155 standard</li>

  <li>Native assets + ERC721 + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155 standard</li>

  <li>Native assets + ERC20 + ERC721 + ERC1155 tokens - TRON does not support 1155
  standard</li>

  </ul>

  <p>All of these options could be enabled with a batch mode as well - in 1 transaction,
  it is possible to transfer multiple different assets from that address, e.g. ETH
  + USDC + ERC721 token.

  Without batch mode, 3 separate transaction must have been performed.</p>

  <p>This operation deploys a smart contract on the blockchain. More assets you will
  support, more intial gas will be used for address creation. Batch mode adds more
  gas for every type.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>TRON (except for Multi Tokens)</li>

  </ul>
