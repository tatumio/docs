  <p>Transfer (send) multiple assets from a gas pump address to one or more addresses.</p>

  <p>This operation is usually performed by users in your custodial application: a
  user who has a gas pump address assigned wants to transfer multiple assets to one
  or more addresses on the blockchain.</p>

  <p>The gas fee for sending the assets will be covered by crypto funds on the master
  address. Make sure that the master address always has enough funds to cover gas
  fees.</p>

  <p>To be able to send the assets:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>The gas pump address must be <a href="#operation/ActivateGasPumpAddresses">activated</a>.<br/>To
  check whether the gas pump address is activated, use <a href="#operation/GasPumpAddressesActivatedOrNot">this
  API</a>.</li>

  <li>The gas pump address must be the owner of the assets.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>If you want to send only one asset, you can also use the <a href="#operation/TransferCustodialWallet">API
  for transferring an asset from a gas pump account</a>.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>TRON</li>

  <li>XinFin</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When transferring assets, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must
  sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the
  fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
