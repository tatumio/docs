  <p>Burn fungible tokens. Burning fungible tokens deletes the specified supply of
  the tokens (the <code>amount</code> parameter in the request body) from the smart
  contract (the <code>contractAddress</code> parameter in the request body).</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Algorand</li>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>KuCoin Community Chain</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>XinFin</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When burning fungible tokens, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you
  must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which
  the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
