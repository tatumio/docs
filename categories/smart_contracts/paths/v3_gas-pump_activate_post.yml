summary: Activate gas pump addresses
description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Activate the <a href="#operation/PrecalculateGasPumpAddresses">precalulated gas
  pump addresses</a>. Activating a gas pump address allows this address to send funds
  to other addresses.</p>

  <p>You can activate up to 270 addresses in one call. If you need to activate more
  than 270 addresses, make several API calls. For example, if you need to activate
  500 addresses, make an API call with 270 addresses (set up the range of their index
  values accordingly in the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> request body parameters)
  and then make another API call with the remaining 230 addresses.</p>

  <p><b>When to activate a gas pump address</b><br/>

  Because activating a gas pump address costs some amount of gas on a blockchain,
  you want to activate only those addresses that will be used for sending funds to
  other addresses. If you know that a gas pump address will not be used for sending
  funds, you can leave this address not activated. The customer who uses this address
  will still be able to receive funds.</p>

  <p>Depending on your business needs and requirements, you can choose when to activate
  the gas pump addresses. If you know for sure that all the precalculated addresses
  will be sending funds, you can activate all the addresses right after they have
  been precalculated.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you can set up the activation in such a way so that a gas pump
  address gets activated only when a specific event is triggered. For example, you
  can activate a gas pump address:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>When it receives an asset for the first time</li>

  <li>When the customer tries to send an asset from this address for the first time</li>

  </ul>

  <p>After you make an API call to activate gas pump addresses, use the <a href="#operation/ActivatedNotActivatedGasPumpAddresses">API
  for getting the results of the address activation transaction</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Paying the gas fee for activating gas pump addresses</b><br/>

  You can pay the gas fees for each activation transaction yourself, or Tatum can
  cover it for you.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>When <b>paying the gas fees yourself</b>, you must sign the transaction with
  either the private key of the blockchain address from which you want to pay the
  fees or the signature ID of that private key (if you use <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Key-Management-System"
  target="_blank">Key Management System</a>, KMS).<br/>

  To pay the fees yourself, use this API with any schema of the request body except
  for <code>ActivateGasPumpTatum</code>. For example, if you are activating gas pump
  addresses on Ethereum and you use KMS, use the <code>ActivateGasPumpKMS</code> schema.

  </li>

  <li>If you want <b>Tatum to cover the fees</b>, use this API with the <code>ActivateGasPumpTatum</code>
  schema of the request body.

  <ul>

  <li>On the <b>mainnet</b>, you have to have a <a href="https://tatum.io/pricing"
  target="_blank">paid pricing plan</a>.<br/>

  Tatum pays the fees from its own blockchain address. Then, the fee amount paid by
  Tatum is converted to the number of credits, and these credits are deducted from
  the monthly credit allowance of your paid pricing plan. The transaction fees and
  the corresponding numbers of credits deducted from your allowance vary depending
  on what blockchain you activate the addresses.</li>

  <li>On the <b>testnet</b>, only one credit is deducted from the monthly credit allowance
  for transaction fee. You can activate gas pump addresses regardless of your pricing
  plan.</li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  </ul>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>TRON</li>

  </ul>
