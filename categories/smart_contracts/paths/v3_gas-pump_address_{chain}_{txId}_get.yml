summary: Get the results of the address activation transaction
description: '<p><b>1 credit per API call</b></p>

  <p>Get the results of the activation transaction after <a href="#operation/ActivateGasPumpAddresses">activating
  gas pump addresses</a>.</p>

  <p>If the activation transaction got recorded into a block, the API returns two
  arrays:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><code>valid</code>, with the activated gas pump addresses</li>

  <li><code>invalid</code>, with the gas pump addresses that for some reason did not
  get activated together with the reason why</li>

  </ul>

  <p>If the transaction is still being processed, the API returns an error message.
  In this case, repeat the call later.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>TRON</li>

  </ul>
