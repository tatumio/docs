summary: Precalculate gas pump addresses
description: "<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>\n<p>Precalculate (generate) gas\
  \ pump addresses that you can assign to the customers of your custodial application.</p>\n\
  <p>This API does not make any changes on the blockchain itself, just generates addresses\
  \ that follow the blockchain's requirements for the address format; therefore, no\
  \ gas fee is applied.</p>\n<p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>\n\
  <ul>\n<li>BNB Smart Chain</li>\n<li>Celo</li>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Harmony</li>\n\
  <li>Klaytn</li>\n<li>Polygon</li>\n<li>TRON</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Address index</b><br/>\n\
  Each address should be associated with its own index. Use the <code>from</code>\
  \ and <code>to</code> request body parameters to set a range of index values for\
  \ the addresses to precalculate. You can start with any number, but we recommend\
  \ that you start from 0.</p>\n<p>In one API call, you can precalculate:</p>\n<ul>\n\
  <li>Up to 4,000 addresses for Harmony</li>\n<li>Up to 500 addresses for TRON</li>\n\
  <li>Up to 5,000 addresses for the other supported blockchains</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If\
  \ you need more addresses than one API call can precalculate, make several API calls.\
  \ For example, if you need 10,000 addresses on Ethereum, make an API call with an\
  \ index range from 0 through 4,999 and then make another API call with an index\
  \ range from 5,000 through 9,999.</p>\n<p>The order in which the precalculated addresses\
  \ are returned in the API response is the order of the values in the index range,\
  \ and the index values are assigned to the addresses accordingly.<br/>For example,\
  \ you precalculated three gas pump addresses with a range of index values from 3\
  \ to 5. The first address in the returned arrray is assigned the index value \"\
  3\", the second one - \"4\", and the third one - \"5\".</p>\n<pre>\n[\n  \"0x8cb76aed9c5e336ef961265c6079c14e9cd3d2ea\"\
  , // index is 3\n  \"0x5c6079c14e9cd3d2ea8cb76aed9c5e336ef96126\", // index is 4\n\
  \  \"0xc5e336ef9612614e9cd3d2ea8cb76aed95c6079c\"  // index is 5\n]\n</pre>\n<p><b>The\
  \ owner of the gas pump addresses</b><br/>\nThe owner (also referred to as \"master\
  \ address\") is the blockchain address that will own the precalculated gas pump\
  \ addresses. The owner will also be paying gas fees for operations made on the gas\
  \ pump addresses. You have to make sure that the owner always has enough funds to\
  \ cover these gas fees.</p>\n<p><b>Activated and not activated addresses</b><br/>\n\
  The precalculated addresses can be immediately assigned to customers and can <b>receive</b>\
  \ funds. However, they cannot be used to <b>send</b> funds to other addresses. This\
  \ is because the addresses are not activated. To make the addresses be able to send\
  \ funds, <a href=\"#operation/ActivateGasPumpAddresses\">activate them</a>.</p>\n"
