description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Create a fixed amount of multiple Multi Tokens Tokens and transfer them to destination
  account in one transaction. Create and transfer Multi Tokens tokens from smart contract
  defined in contractAddress.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>KuCoin Community Chain</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b></p>

  <p>When minting multiple Multi Tokens, you are charged a fee for the transaction,
  and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address
  from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
