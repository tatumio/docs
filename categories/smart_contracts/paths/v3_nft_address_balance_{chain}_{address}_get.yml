description: '<p><b>1 credit per API call + 5 credits for each owned NFT</b></p>

  <p>Get all NFTs that a blockchain address holds. The NFTs are returned grouped by
  the smart contracts they were minted on.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Algorand</li>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain - mainnet only</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Ethereum</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>Solana</li>

  </ul>

  <p>On Solana and Algorand, if a blockchain address holds fewer than 50 NFTs, the
  API also returns each NFT''s metadata. If the metadata is not returned, you can
  obtain it using the <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/NFT-(ERC-721-or-compatible)/#operation/NftGetMetadataErc721">API
  for getting NFT metadata</a>.</p>
