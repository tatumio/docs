description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call + additional credits based on the size
  of the stored data and the type of the blockchain</b></p>

  <p>Store data on the blockchain.</p>

  <p>The total cost of a transaction on Ethereum (in credits) depends on the size
  of the data. The data is stored as a string in the hexadecimal format, and the maximum
  size of the data is approximately 130 kB on the mainnet and 30 kB on testnet. Every
  5 characters cost 1 credit.<br/>

  Therefore, one API call with 1 kB of data (1024 characters) would cost 205 credits.</p>

  <p>This API is supported for the following blockchains:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>BNB Smart Chain</li>

  <li>Celo</li>

  <li>Elrond</li>

  <li>Ethereum (only the mainnet or the Sepolia testnet)</li>

  <li>Harmony</li>

  <li>Klaytn</li>

  <li>Polygon</li>

  <li>XDC</li>

  </ul>
