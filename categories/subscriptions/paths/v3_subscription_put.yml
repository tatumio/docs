description: '<h4>2 credits per API call.</h4><br/><p>Enable HMAC hash ID on the fired
  webhooks from Tatum API.

  In order to make sure that a webhook is sent by us, we have the possibility to sign
  it with the HMAC Sha512 Hex algorithm.<br/>

  To verify that a webhook is sent by us

  <ol>

  <li>Get a webhook <b>x-payload-hash</b> header value and payload as it is as a JSON
  file.</li>

  <li>Convert the HTTP webhook body to stringify JSON without any spaces. In JavaScript,
  you would do it like this <pre>JSON.stringify(req.body)</pre></li>

  <li>Perform calculations on your side to create a digest using Secret Key, webhook
  payload in bytes and HMAC SHA512 algorithm. JavaScript example:

  <pre>require(''crypto'').createHmac(''sha512'', hmacSecret).update(JSON.stringify(req.body)).digest(''base64'')</pre>.</li>

  <li>Compare x-payload-hash header value with calculated digest as a Base64 string.</li></p>
