description: '<h4>2 credits per API call.</h4><br/>

  <p>Blocks an amount in an account. Any number of distinct amounts can be blocked
  in one account.

  Every new blockage has its own distinct ID, which is used as a reference. When the
  amount is blocked, it is debited from the available balance of the account.

  The account balance remains the same. The account balance represents the total amount
  of funds in the account. The available balance represents the total amount of funds
  that can be used to perform transactions. When an account is frozen, the available
  balance is set to 0 minus all blockages for the account.</p>
