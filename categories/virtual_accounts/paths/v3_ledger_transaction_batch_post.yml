description: '<h4>2 + 2 * N per API call. (N - count of transactions)</h4><br/>

  <p>Sends the N payments within Tatum Private Ledger. All assets are settled instantly.<br/>

  When a transaction is settled, 2 transaction records are created, 1 for each of
  the participants. These 2 records are connected via a transaction reference, which
  is the same for both of them.<br/>

  This method is only used for transferring assets between accounts within Tatum and
  will not send any funds to blockchain addresses.<br/>

  If there is an insufficient balance in the sender account, no transaction is recorded.<br/>

  It is possible to perform an anonymous transaction where the sender account is not
  visible for the recipient.<br/>

  The FIAT currency value of every transaction is calculated automatically. The FIAT
  value is based on the accountingCurrency of the account connected to the transaction
  and is available in the marketValue parameter of the transaction.</p>
