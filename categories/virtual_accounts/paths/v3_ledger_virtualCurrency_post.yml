  <p>Create new virtual currency with given supply stored in account. This will create
  Tatum internal virtual currency. Every virtual currency must be prefixed with <b>VC_</b>.</p>

  <p>Every virtual currency must be pegged to existing FIAT or supported cryptocurrency.
  1 unit of virtual currency has then the same amount as 1 unit of the base currency
  it is pegged to. It is possible to set a custom base rate for the virtual currency.
  (baseRate = 2 => 1 VC unit = 2 basePair units)</p>

  <p>Tatum virtual currency acts as any other asset within Tatum. To create a fungible
  token, see the <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Fungible-Tokens-(ERC-20-or-compatible)#operation/Erc20Deploy"
  target="_blank">API for deploying a fungible token smart contract</a>.</p>

  <p>This operation returns the newly created Tatum Ledger account with an initial
  balance set to the virtual currency''s total supply. Total supply can be changed
  in the future.</p>
