  <p>Create multiple deposit addresses associated with a virtual account.</p>

  <p>When you have multiple deposit addresses created for the same virtual account,
  you aggregate various blockchain transactions from different addresses under a single
  account.<br/>You can deposit funds from another blockchain address to a deposit
  address associated with the virtual account, and the funds will be credited to that
  virtual account.</p>

  <p><b>Scanning for incoming deposits</b><br/>

  By default, deposit addresses are scanned for incoming deposits. Deposit addresses
  are automatically synchronized with the associated virtual account, and you can
  see incoming deposits on the virtual account.<br/>Scanning deposit addresses for
  incoming deposits consumes <b>20 credits per address per day</b>.</p>

  <p>If you want to be notified about certain events occurring on the deposit addresses,
  <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Notification-subscriptions#operation/createSubscription"
  target="_blank">subscribe for notifications</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Virtual account cryptocurrency</b></p>

  <p>Depending on the cryptocurrency of the virtual account, this API generates:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><b>Public address</b> for BTC, BCH, ETH, or LTC</li>

  <li><b>DestinationTag</b> for XRP</li>

  <li><b>Message</b> for XLM</li>

  </ul>

  <p>For fore information about supported blockchains and address types, see the <a
  href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Account#operation/createAccount" target="_blank">API
  for creating virtual accounts</a>.</p>

  <p>Deposit addresses are generated in the natural order of the extended public key
  provided in the virtual account. The derivation index is the representation of that
  order; it starts from 0 and ends at 2^31.</p>

  <p>When a new deposit address is generated, the last not used index is used to generate
  the address. You can skip some addresses to a different index, which means all the
  skipped addresses will no longer be used.</p>
