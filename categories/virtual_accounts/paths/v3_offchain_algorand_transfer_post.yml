description: '<p><b>4 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Send Algos or ERC-20-equivalent Algorand tokens from a virtual account (even
  from a virtual account without deposit addresses adssigned) to the Algorand blockchain.</p>

  <p>The recipient has to agree in advance to receive assets because Algorand charges
  users for storing assets on their addresses, and an Algorand blockchain address
  by default does not receive assets unless explicitly agreed. Before sending any
  asset from a virtual account to the blockchain, make sure that the recipient <a
  href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Algorand#operation/AlgorandBlockchainReceiveAsset"
  target="_blank">has agreed to receive the assets</a> to their address.</p>

  <p>Sending Algorand assets creates an internal Tatum withdrawal request with an
  ID. If everything works as expected, the withdrawal request is marked as complete
  and a transaction ID is assigned to it.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>If a server connection is unavailable, the withdrawal request is cancelled.</li>

  <li>If the transfer to the blockchain is successful, but the Tatum infrastructure
  cannot be accesses, the ID of the blockchain transaction is returned and you have
  to <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Withdrawal#operation/completeWithdrawal"
  target="_blank">complete the withdrawal request manually</a>. Otherwise, all other
  withdrawals will be pending.</li>

  </ul>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When sending Algos or ERC-20-equivalent Algorand tokens, you are charged a fee for
  the transaction, and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain
  address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
