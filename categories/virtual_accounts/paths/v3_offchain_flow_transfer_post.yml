description: '<h4>100 credits per API call. Tatum covers the fee connected to the
  transaction costs in subscription credits. This operation can be done on mainnet
  only for paid plans.</h4><br/>

  <p>Send FLOW (Flow) or FUSD from a virtual account to the blockchain. This will
  create Tatum internal withdrawal request with ID. If every system works as expected,
  withdrawal request is marked as complete and transaction id is assigned to it.

  <ul>

  <li>If Flow server connection is unavailable, withdrawal request is cancelled.</li>

  <li>If blockchain transfer is successful, but is it not possible to reach Tatum,
  transaction id of blockchain transaction is returned and withdrawal request must
  be completed manually, otherwise all other withdrawals will be pending.</li>

  </ul>

  There are two possibilites how the transaction on the blockchain can be created:

  <ul>

  <li>Using mnemonic and index - private key is generated based on the index in the
  mnemonic.</li>

  <li>Using secret - private keys is entered manually.</li>

  </ul>

  It is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts without
  blockchain address assigned to them.<br/>

  This method is a helper method, which internally wraps these steps:

  <ol>

  <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Withdrawal#operation/storeWithdrawal">Store
  withdrawal</a> - create a ledger transaction, which debits the assets on the sender
  account.</li>

  <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Flow#operation/FlowTransferBlockchain">Perform
  blockchain transaction</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Withdrawal#operation/completeWithdrawal">Complete
  withdrawal</a> - move the withdrawal to the completed state, when all of the previous
  steps were successful.</li>

  </ol>

  This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds
  are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.

  No one should ever send it''s own private keys to the internet because there is
  a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible
  to enter privateKey

  or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet
  versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,

  <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should
  be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in
  the request.

  Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.</p>
