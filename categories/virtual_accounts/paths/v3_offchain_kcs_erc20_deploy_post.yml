description: '<p><b>4 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Deploy a KuCoin Community Chain (KCC) ERC-20-equivalent smart contract. This
  is a helper method, which is combination of

  <a href="#operation/registerErc20Token">Register new Kcs ERC20 token in the ledger</a>
  and <a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Fungible-Tokens-(ERC-20-or-compatible)#operation/Erc20Deploy">Deploy
  blockchain ERC20</a>.</p>

  <p>After deploying a contract to blockchain, the contract address will become available
  and must be stored within Tatum. Otherwise, it will not be possible to interact
  with it and starts automatic blockchain synchronization.</p>

  <p><b>Signing a transaction</b><br/>

  When deploying a KCC ERC-20-equivalent smart contract to the blockchain and a virtual
  account, you are charged a fee for the transaction, and you must sign the transaction
  with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted.</p>

  <p>Providing the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions,
  because the private key can be stolen or exposed. Your private keys should never
  leave your security perimeter. You should use the private keys only for testing
  a solution you are building on the <b>testnet</b> of a blockchain.</p>

  <p>For signing transactions on the <b>mainnet</b>, we strongly recommend that you
  use the Tatum <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Key
  Management System (KMS)</a> and provide the signature ID instead of the private
  key in the API. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-js/tree/v2"
  target="_blank">Tatum JavaScript client</a>.</p>
