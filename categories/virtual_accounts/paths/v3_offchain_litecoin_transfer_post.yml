  <p>Send LTC (Litecoin) from a virtual account to the blockchain. This will create
  Tatum internal withdrawal request with ID. If every system works as expected, withdrawal
  request is marked as complete and transaction id is assigned to it.

  <ul>

  <li>If Litecoin server connection is unavailable, withdrawal request is cancelled.</li>

  <li>If blockchain transfer is successful, but is it not possible to reach Tatum,
  transaction id of blockchain transaction is returned and withdrawal request must
  be completed manually, otherwise all other withdrawals will be pending.</li>

  </ul>

  There are two possibilites how the transaction on the blockchain can be created:

  <ul>

  <li>Using mnemonic - all of the addresses, that are generated from the mnemonic
  are scanned for the incoming deposits

  which are used as a source of the transaction. Assets, which are not used in a transaction
  are moved to the system address wih the derivation index 0. Address with index 0
  cannot be assigned automatically to any account and is used for custodial wallet
  use cases. For non-custodial wallets, field <b>attr</b> should be present and it
  should be address with the index 1 of the connected wallet.</li>

  <li>Using keyPair - addresses which are used as a source of the transaction are
  entered manually</li>

  </ul>

  It is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts without
  blockchain address assigned to them.<br/>

  This method is a helper method, which internally wraps these steps:

  <ol>

  <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Withdrawal#operation/storeWithdrawal">Store
  withdrawal</a> - create a ledger transaction, which debits the assets on the sender
  account.</li>

  <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Litecoin#operation/LtcTransferBlockchain">Perform
  blockchain transaction</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://apidoc.tatum.io/tag/Withdrawal#operation/completeWithdrawal">Complete
  withdrawal</a> - move the withdrawal to the completed state, when all of the previous
  steps were successful.</li>

  </ol>

  This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds
  are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key.

  No one should ever send it''s own private keys to the internet because there is
  a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible
  to enter privateKey

  or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet
  versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,

  <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should
  be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in
  the request.

  Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.</p>
