  <p>Send SOL (Solana), USDC_SOL, or custom SPL tokens from a virtual account to the
  blockchain. This will create Tatum internal withdrawal request with ID. When every
  system works as expected,

  withdrawal request is marked as complete and transaction id is assigned to it.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>If SOL server connection is unavailable, withdrawal request is cancelled.</li>

  <li>If blockchain transfer is successful, but is it not possible to reach Tatum,
  transaction id of blockchain transaction is returned and withdrawal request must
  be completed manually, otherwise all other withdrawals will be pending.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>It is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts
  without blockchain address assigned to them.</p>

  <p>This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the
  funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private
  key.

  No one should ever send it''s own private keys to the internet because there is
  a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible
  to enter privateKey

  or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet
  versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production,

  <a href="https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms" target="_blank">Tatum KMS</a> should
  be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in
  the request.

  Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.
