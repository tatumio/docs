description: '<p><b>2 credits per API call</b></p>

  <p>Set the contract address of an ERC-20, ERC-20-equivalent (for example, BEP-20,
  HRM-20, and so on), or TRC-10 token to be able to communicate with the smart contract.</p>

  <p>After creating and deploying the token to the blockchain, the smart contract
  address is generated and must be set within Tatum. If the address is not set, the
  Tatum platform will not be able to detect incoming deposits of the tokens and transfer
  the tokens from virtual accounts to blockchain addresses.</p>

  <p><b>NOTE:</b></p>

  <ul>

  <li>For <b>Algorand</b>, the contract address is the asset ID (<code>assetId</code>),
  for example, <code>55351976</code>.</li>

  <li>For <b>TRON</b>, the contract address is the token ID (<code>tokenId</code>),
  for example, <code>1234567</code>.</li>

  </ul>
