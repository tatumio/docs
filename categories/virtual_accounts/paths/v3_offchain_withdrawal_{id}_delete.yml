  <p>This method is helpful if you need to cancel the withdrawal if the blockchain
  transaction fails or is not yet processed.

  This does not cancel already broadcast blockchain transaction, only Tatum internal
  withdrawal, and the ledger transaction, that was linked to this withdrawal.<br/>

  By default, the transaction fee is included in the reverted transaction. There are
  situations, like sending ERC20 on ETH, TRC token on TRON, XLM or XRP based assets,
  when the fee should not be reverted, because e.g. the fee is in calculated

  in Ethereum and transaction was in ERC20 currency. In this situation, only the transaction
  amount should be reverted, not the fee.
