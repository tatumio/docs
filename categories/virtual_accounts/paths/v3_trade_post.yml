description: "<h4>2 credits for API call, 2 credits for each fill of the counter trade.\
  \ 1 API call + 2 fills  = 6 credits.</h4><br/>\n<p>Store new buy / sell trade. If\
  \ there is trade already available to fill, fill as much trades as possible.<br/>\n\
  It is possible to charge fees for the trades. Fees are an extra amount on top of\
  \ the trade amount and are paid in the currency that you going to block\ne.g.:\n\
  - BUY BTC/USDT - fees will be paid in USDT\n- SELL BTC/ETH - fees will be paid in\
  \ BTC\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf you fill type of the trade with FUTURE_BUY or FUTURE_SELL\
  \ the trade will behave as a trade future. The trade is concluded now but will be\
  \ fulfilled in future.\nThe date of fulfillment is by the \u201CSeal Date\u201D\
  \ field. You can also block a percentage of the amount until the future trade has\
  \ expired.\n</p>\n<p>Futures can also penalize contracting parties if they don\u2019\
  t have the agreed balance available in their accounts.\nThe penalty is calculated\
  \ in the following way: Penalty amount = (Percentage of incomplete deal amount because\
  \ of shortage from user) \xD7 (Maximum Penalty percentage of futures deal based\
  \ on blocked amount and time interval) \xD7 (total blocked value).\n</p>\n<p>Example\
  \ of the BTC/USDT trade future:</p>\n<p>The maker creates a sell with the following\
  \ properties: 1 BTC at a price of 60000 USDT, with a blocking percentage of 22%,\
  \ a penalty percentage of 45%, a system commision of 1% and with an expiration time\
  \ of within 12 hours.</p>\n<pre>\n{\n  \"type\": \"FUTURE_SELL\",\n  \"price\":\
