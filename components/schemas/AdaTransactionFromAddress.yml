    description: The array of blockchain addresses to send the assets to and the amounts
      that each address should receive (in ADA). The difference between the UTXOs
      calculated in the <code>fromAddress</code> section and the total amount to receive
      calculated in the <code>to</code> section will be used as the gas fee. To explicitly
      specify the fee amount and the blockchain address where any extra funds remaining
      after covering the fee will be sent, set the <code>fee</code> and <code>changeAddress</code>
