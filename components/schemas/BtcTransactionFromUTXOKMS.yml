    description: The array of transaction hashes, indexes of its UTXOs, and the signature
      IDs of the associated blockchain addresses

  to:
    description: The array of blockchain addresses to send the assets to and the amounts
      that each address should receive (in BTC). The difference between the UTXOs
      calculated in the <code>fromUTXO</code> section and the total amount to receive
      calculated in the <code>to</code> section will be used as the gas fee. To explicitly
      specify the fee amount and the blockchain address where any extra funds remaining
      after covering the fee will be sent, set the <code>fee</code> and <code>changeAddress</code>
      parameters.

  fee:
    type: string
    description: The fee to be paid for the transaction (in BTC); if you are using
      this parameter, you have to also use the <code>changeAddress</code> parameter
      because these two parameters only work together.
    example: '0.0015'
  changeAddress:
    description: The blockchain address to send any extra assets remaning after covering
      the fee; if you are using this parameter, you have to also use the <code>fee</code>
      parameter because these two parameters only work together.
