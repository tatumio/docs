      close_flags:
        type: integer
        description: 'A bit-map of flags relating to the closing of this ledger. Currently,
          the ledger has only one flag defined for close_flags: sLCF_NoConsensusTime
          (value 1). If this flag is enabled, it means that validators were in conflict
          regarding the correct close time for the ledger, but build otherwise the
          same ledger, so they declared consensus while "agreeing to disagree" on
          the close time. In this case, the consensus ledger contains a close_time
          that is 1 second after that of the previous ledger. (In this case, there
          is no official close time, but the actual real-world close time is probably
          3-6 seconds later than the specified close_time.)'
